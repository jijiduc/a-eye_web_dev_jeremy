# Multi-users segmentation (MUS)

The MUS aim to enable multiple users to use the segmentation pipeline in parallel.

Slurm informations are documented [in the initial map.](map_v0.md#L87)

## Initial assesment on MUS
*In this section, links were correctly referencing functions before the fixes*

Race concurrence and data loss issues in MUS context are present and need to be fixed :

On HPC side : 

- `modify_jobfile()`, in [utils.py:540](../utils.py#L540), creates unique folder per user on chacha (like `/home/jaime.barrancohernandez/results/nnunet/<email>_<timestamp>/`). The results of the segmentation are therefore isolated.

On the a-eye_web side :

1. in [config.py](../config.py) :
    - The local paths are shared in [config.py:13-18](../config.py#L13-L18) for all users. Therefore, files would be mixed between concurrent users.
    - The HPC input path is also shared in [config.py:25](../config.py#L25). Concurrent users would then mix files. 
    - The HPC jobfile is also shared in [config.py:27](../config.py#L27). Concurrent users would then overwrite jobs. Thus this is a very unlikely scenario as once `sbatch`is made, any later `scp` overwritte won't have effect on it. Only a tiny, almost-simulteanous, timeframe between two `/segment` calls would trigger this issue.

2. `clean_folders()`, in [utils.py:445](../utils.py#L445), clear every previous logs and file on each `/upload`, in [routes.py:166](../routes.py#L166). This would lead to data loss. When a second user uploads data, it clear the previous user's one.

## Initial tests

Using 2 differents users accounts (having 4 at disposal) , I tested the assesment that : 

- `clean_folders()` does clear data on each uploads.

Other suspected issues aren't testable as is, because the race concurrence issues are "prevented" by the data loss effect of `clean_folders()`.

### Encountered issues 

User experience :

- `/segment`, because of the `--wait` argument in the batch command, block a FLask thread and provide no status information/update. The effect is that the user can't go to another page of the aeye website while waiting for the results. In case of quiting/reloading, status and job following is lost. 

*This is not on the agenda for the moment*


## Planned changes
For MUS correction

+ Paths isolation 
    - use the same logic of unique folder creation to solve the paths issues (using user email)
    - also isolated segmentation request input on HPC
+ `clean_folders()` at user scope to only wipe it's data

*Remark* a cleaner practice would never use path as direct reference, but derive it from a structured object (like dataclass)

For UX improvements :

+ Async task handling
    - use an async task handler for the `/segment`*.

*\*celery is suggestion made by Jaime Barranco*

## Changes made

- added `models.py` containing `UserPaths` dataclass. This to holds all user-scoped paths for a single user's pipeline run in a centralized place.

### [utils.py](../utils.py)

- added `get_user_paths(user_email)` : 
    - a function to get all `UserPaths` fields from the user's email
- added `clear_folder(folder)` :
    -  a wrap of `delete_files_in_folder` and `delete_subfolders`
- modified `clean_folders(user_email)` : 
    - changed to wipes data belonging to only a given user
- modified `modify_jobfile()` : 
    - added the `hpc_input` parameter to isolate the HPC input bind per user

### [main.py](../main.py)

- modified `getSegmentation(user_email, paths)` : 
    - use a `UserPaths` object and old path reference updated

### [routes.py](../routes.py)

- modified `/upload`,  `/segment` and `/download` : 
    - extracts `user_email` from session and update the old path to now `paths` via `get_user_paths`


### Tests of changes
I conducted 3 tests on the segmentation process updated. During those I used sample datas and monitor evolution with the job in queue (in Dance) on [chacha](cheat_sheet.md#L40), the live logs from the [running docker container](cheat_sheet.md#L16-24) and verification of upload on Filer01: 

- using 1 account : upload and full pipeline completed successfully
- using 2 accounts in simul: both users uploaded concurrently. Two separate jobs submitted and completed independently. Results stored in distinct user folders — no data mixing observed
- using 4 accounts in simul: all 4 users uploaded concurrently. Four separate HPC jobs submitted. Results came back in stages, each correctly isolated to the corresponding user's folder and filer path — no data mixing observed

#### Conclusion 
I conclude that these tests validate my implementation and successfully correct the MUS issues.

### Feedback on the changes
After a meeting with Jaime some minors changes should be made :
1. If an error is raised during the segmentation process (on the web side): 
    - data should be removed and termination of the segmentation process on Slurm.
2. There should be no data being left-over on the VM.

## Reload cancellation
When the user reloads the page, a new `GET /segmentation` is made at page reload.
Using this signal, the fix works by using the internal method `_cancel_job` being called in the `/segmentation`route, thus cancelling any running job at reload.

The current website implementation uses Gunicorn with 4 different worker processes. As each worker has isolated memory, a `.txt` file is temporarily created on disk to provide the job ID to any of them.

`_cancel_job` was also added in `POST /upload` and `POST /segment` to stop any running processes from the user if a new pipeline is used.

### [models.py](../models.py)

- added `active_job_file: Path` field to `UserPaths`:
    - Serve to store the ongoing Slurm job ID as plain text (at `static/active_jobs/<sanitized_email>.txt`). It exists while a job is active; deleted on completion, error, or cancellation

### [main.py](../main.py)

- modified `getSegmentation(user_email, paths, ongoing_job_id)`:
    - added an optional `ongoing_job_id: Callable[[str], None] | None` parameter. Used if provided, with the `job_id` retrieved
    - added `readline()`that captures the ID before `communicate()` blocks it, thus enabling cancellation mid-job

### [routes.py](../routes.py)

- added `_cancel_job(paths: UserPaths)`:
    - called at the top of `GET /segmentation`, `POST /upload`, and `POST /segment`, it reads the job ID from `active_job_file`, delete it and call `cancel_slurm_job(job_id)`

- modified `POST /segment`:
    - added `store_job_id(job_id)` : writes the job ID to `active_job_file`
    - delete `active_job_file` after process succeed/failed

### Test

Tested with different accounts, also in quasi-simulteanous fashion : logs and observation of the Slurm queue showed the `scancel` effect being in action.

### About the page quitting job cancellation

Unlike the reload fix, quitting the page doesn't provide any usable signal on the server-side. To detect this case adding a separate background thread, constantly looking for the active jobs, would be an example of solution.

However, this would require adding a lot of specific custom-made infrastructure, that wouldn't be easy to scale up later. Thus, it would be cleaner to switch to a celery + redis infrastructure, to handle the jobs.

As the platform is still in alpha-testing phase, better to get reviews before making such important changes.

## Small improvement 

As discussed with Jaime, the name of the provided file from `output.zip` has been changed for `output_<email>_<timestamp>.zip`
